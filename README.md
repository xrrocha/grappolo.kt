# Grappolo Kotlin

Simple (but not super-efficient) hierarchical agglomerative clustering in Kotlin.

Appropriate for small sets of strings (e.g., using normalized string distance metrics)
as well as vectors (e.g., using tfidf and cosine distance).

Uses simple elbow heuristic to cut distance-based cluster evaluation.
